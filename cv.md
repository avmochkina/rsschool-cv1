### About Me

My privious job leaded me to stagnation and I think that I need to change something. It happened  that I got interested in design and web development, so I finished a design course in 2021. Thanks to that I have acquired some knowledge of HTML and CSS, design systems and UX patterns.
Now my focus is on front-end development and RS School helps me to learn it. I have been studying for six months and I know so much already.  My personal skills such as:

 + Creativity and good imagination
 + Being a hard-working person 
 + Fast learner
 + and also Iâ€™m an excellent team worker
help me to learn more quickly and efficiently. I'm willing to study and become an excellent front-end developer. I'm excited about what I've been working on. I'm always up for a challenge and I'm looking for a place where I can continue to grow and learn.
